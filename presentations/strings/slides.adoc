= Compound types - Structs, Tuples, Strings 

link:./index.html[Table of Contents]

== Structs

`struct`s group and name data of different types.

== Definition

[source,rust]
----
include::./1_5.rs[]
----

== Construction

[.notes]
--
- there is no partial initialization
--

[source,rust]
----
include::./2_5.rs[]
----

== Side note

It's common to hide construction behind a call to `Point::new()` instead of using a raw struct literal.

== Field Access

[.notes]
--
- note: no `->` operator for structs behind pointers, always `.`

== Strings

There are several different kinds of strings in Rust.

Most common are `String` and `&str`.

== `String`

-   *Owns* the data it stores, and can be mutated freely.
-   Exists as a pointer to some bytes, a length, and a capacity.
-   Exists on the *heap*.
-   Does not implement `Copy`, but implements `Clone`.

== `&str`

-   An immutable reference to a string slice.
-   Only seen as a borrowed value.
-   May be anywhere, on the heap, stack, or in program memory.

== Creation

[source,rust]
----
include::./1.rs[]

== When to Use What?

-   `String` is the *easiest* to use when starting out. Refine later.
-   `String` owns its data, so works well as a field of a `struct` or Enum.
-   `&str` is typically used in function arguments.

== `Deref` Coercion

Just because multiple types exist doesn't mean they can't work in harmony.

This is because `String` s implement `Deref<Target=str>` .

== Exotic String types

-   `OsStr` and `OsString` may show up when working with file systems or system calls.

-   `CStr` and `CString` may show up when working with FFI.

The differences between `[Os|C]Str` and `[Os|C]String` are generally the same as the normal types.

== `OsString` & `OsStr`

These types represent *platform native* strings. This is necessary because Unix and Windows strings have different characteristics.

== Behind the `OsString` Scenes

-   Unix strings are often arbitrary non-zero sequences, usually interpreted as UTF-8.
-   Windows strings are often arbitrary non-zero sequences, usually interpreted as UTF-16.
-   Rust strings are always valid UTF-8, and may contain zeros.

`OsString` and `OsStr` bridge this gap and allow for cheap converstion to and from `String` and `str`.

== `CString` & `CStr`

These types represent valid C compatible strings.

They are predominantly used when doing FFI with external code.

It is strongly recommended you read *all* of the documentation on these types before using them.

== Common String Tasks

Splitting:

Concatenation:

== Common String Tasks

Replacing:

[source,rust]
----
include::./5.rs[]
----

== Accepting `String` or `str`

It's possible to accept either rather painlessly:

[source,rust]

include::./6.rs[]
----

== Raw String Literals

-   Starts with `r` followed by zero or more `#` followed by `"`
-   Ends with `"` followed by the same number of `#`
-   Can span multiple lines, leading spaces become part of the line
-   Escape sequences are not processed

[source,rust]
----
include::./7.rs[]

== Byte String Literals

* not really strings
* used to declare static byte slices (have a `&[u8]` type)
