== !

Cargo is the standard build toolchain for Rust.

Every release of `rustc` is shipped with a specific version of cargo.

In general, cargo is independent of the used `rustc` version.

== Projects

A cargo project contains (at minimum):

- A Manifest (Cargo.toml)
- A source file (library or application) in the `src` folder (default)

== !

In addition, a cargo project can contain:

- tests (default directory `tests`)
- benchmarks (default directory `benches`)
- a build script (default `build.rs`)
- examples (default directory `examples`)

==  The Manifest

The http://doc.crates.io/manifest.html[Cargo Manifest] is written using http://doc.crates.io/manifest.html[TOML].

It at least contains the name of the project.

[source,toml]
----
include::1.toml[]
----

== `cargo build`

`cargo build` builds the whole project and puts the result in the directory `target`.

By default, cargo uses the Debug profile, which means that the resulting binary with be unoptimized and with debug symbols!

`cargo build --release` uses the optimizing profile.

== !


*Always use* `--release` for benchmarks, especially iterators get a huge speed boost from optimizations.

== `cargo run`

If the project contains an application, you can run it using `+cargo run -- [Arguments]+`.

If it contains multiple binaries, the name of the intended binary can be given using `+--bin <name>+`.

The debug profile is default here.

== `cargo test`

`cargo test` runs all tests.

You can provide a test name or module name to filter the test being run.

Tests use the debug profile per default.

`cargo test --workspace --examples` runs all tests, including documentation test and compilation of examples!

== `cargo bench`

`cargo bench` runs all benchmarks.

Benchmarks default to the release profile.

Benchmarks can be written using the `criterion` crate.

== Versioning

In the Rust community https://semver.org[Semantic Versioning] is the recommended versioning standard.

- The major version must be raised if there are breaking interface changes.
- The minor version must be raised if new features are added
- The patch version marks bug fixes and performance improvements.

== Pre-release

If the version of a library is below `1`, it is considered "pre-release", which means breaking interface changes can happen with *every minor version*, and in the `0.0.x` case, with every *patch* version.

== Version expressions

Cargo allows expressing version ranges in different fashions.

- `=1.2.3`: Exact version, cargo will only use that one
- `0.1`: Any patch version of the "0.1" series
- `1.0`: Any minor version of the "1.x" series
- `< 0.8`: Any minor version smaller than "0.8"

For more details, check the http://doc.crates.io/manifest.html[docs]

== Version resolution

At the first build (or through `cargo update`), cargo calculates a version tree fulfilling the constraints stated in Cargo.toml.

If successful, it will be saved in a Lockfile (Cargo.lock).

The Lockfile should always be kept under version control for applications.

For libraries, it can be checked in to provide a repeatable test environment.

== Dependencies in detail

Cargo knows 3 different kinds of dependencies:

- normal dependencies
- build dependencies
- development/test dependencies

== Example

[source,toml]
----
include::./2.toml[]
----

== Dependencies in detail

[source,toml]
----
include::./3.toml[]
----

[source,toml]
----
include::./4.toml[]
----

== Aside

Dependencies outside of crates.io are forbidden if a library is to be published on crates.io.

== Local paths

It is possible to temporarily replace libraries with local ones.

For this, their path needs to be registered in `$PROJECT_PATH/.cargo/config`.

[source,toml]
----
include::./5.toml[]
----

Libraries found here will be preferred. This allows easy testing of patches.

== Profiles

The cargo profiles (release, bench, test...) can be customized.

Details can be found in the http://doc.crates.io/manifest.html[Manifest-documentation].

== Targets

- profiles and dependencies can be configured based on the compilation target
- `+cargo build --target ...+` uses that target
- the target must be installed beforehand
- consider using xargo

== Workspaces

Cargo can group multiple projects in a workspace.

They then share settings and the same `target` directory.

See the http://doc.crates.io/manifest.html[manifest documentation] for details.

== Features

`rustc` provides the ability to ignore certain code parts on compilation.

This happens through feature flags.

[source,rust]
----
include::./6.rs[]
----

== !

These can be registered in `Cargo.toml`.

[source,toml]
----
include::./7.toml[]
----


== !

And then be expressed on a dependency:

[source,toml]
----
include::./8.toml[]
----

or used with `+cargo build --features experimental,other_feature`

== Directly invoking `rustc`

`cargo rustc` invokes `rustc` directly and allows passing of additional parameters.
