Rust's lifetimes are notorious for being hard to understand.

== !

That is not necessary.

== Lifetimes

-   Lifetimes describe the time that values remain in memory
-   They describe - they cannot force or change anything
-   Lifetimes are types!

== You have used them already

== Motivation

include::./4.rs[]

== !

This code would - if it compiled - violate memory safety.

== !

The correct struct definition is:

[source,rust]
----
include::./5.rs[]
----

== !

Container is now:

* Generic over the type T
* As well as a lifetime `'container` (its own)
* The borrowed values must live *at least equally long*

== !

Takeaway:

Lifetimes describe minimal conditions

== Multiple lifetimes in one signature

Lingo: `Input outlives Tokenizer`

== !

Lifetimes cannot do _more_ than describe "this must live longer (or at least equally long) as the other".

== !

Common pitfall: you cannot "shorten a lifetime", as it just describes what's already there.

== `'static`

* as part of a reference, `'static` means "lives forever"
* in trait bounds, the type does not contain any non-static references. That's not necessarily forever!  

== !

Examples of `'static` data are:

* Data contained in the binary, for example static strings
* Heap-allocated values (for example the contents of a `Box`)
    - As long as they are not bound on values that live shorter!
* Globals

== !

`'static` is not an escape hatch. In concurrent, especially evented, programs, `'static` is very common.

This is due to most data having to live outside of the stack.

== !

Lifetimes describe all types, not only references, therefore they are also bounds in generic code.
