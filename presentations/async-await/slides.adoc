==  Welcome

* Own your experience
* Focus on understanding, not on the finish line
* Feel free to code your own
* Ask questions

==  Warning

async-await was stabilized yesterday
* Use newest nightly!
* Adjust your expectation

== Agenda

== !
* Intro (30 min)
* Coding (20 min)
* Programming (20min)
* Tasks and communication (20min)
* Pause (10min)
* Programming (30min)
* Shutdown and faulty connections (20min)
* Programming (30min)
* Closing (5min)

== async-std

* async-std is an implementation Rust's async/await story
* new library, built from the ground up
* familiar interface, new internals

== Tutorial

* Follow the tutorial in https://book.async.rs
* Source + Client available at:
  * https://github.com/async-rs/a-chat
  * Use the client to test your server

== What are Futures?

[source,rust]
----
include::./1.rs[]
----

== Futures

* Types that provide values... at some time in the future
* A form of deferred computation
* Need an executor to poll them
  * Polling is not a user concern!

== Async blocks

* Async blocks are blocks that get transformed into futures
* `await` can only be called in async contexts

== !

[source,rust]
----
include::./4.rs[]
----

== Cold Futures

* Do nothing unless polled
* Calling an async function does nothing

== Tasks

[source,rust]
----
include::./5.rs[]
----

== Tasks

* Tasks in async-std are similar to threads
* They give you a `JoinHandle` and a way to retrieve their results

== Executors

* Components executing Futures
* Multiple implementations possible

== Exercise one

https://book.async.rs

* 3.1
* 3.2
* 3.3

== Communication between Tasks

== Channels and streams

* Channels are a way to communicate between concurrent Tasks
  * Channels have a sender and a receiver
* They are abstracted behind streams
* Channels are closed on drop

== Select/Join

* `Selecting` is waiting for the first of multiple futures
* `Joining` is waiting for all of them

== Exercise Two

https://book.async.rs

* 3.4
* 3.5
* 3.6

== Sleeping/Waking

* Tasks are very good if they _mostly sleep_
* They will be woken up when needed
    * New data from a client
    * Messages in a channel

== Client handling

* Every client `spawns` a task on connection
* On disconnection, they need to be _reaped_
  * Disconnection might be by error

== Shutdown

* Shutdown needs to properly clean up all connections

== Exercise Three

https://book.async.rs

* 3.7
* 3.8
* 3.9
