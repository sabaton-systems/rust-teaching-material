== A Little Look Around

- What is in Cargo.toml?
- What is in Cargo.lock?

For details, check the http://doc.crates.io/manifest.html[Cargo Manifest docs].

== rust-analyzer: Things to know

* With VSCode you need this extension - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer
