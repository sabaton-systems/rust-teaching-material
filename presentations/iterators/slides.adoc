= Iterators

link:./index.html[Table of Contents]


== !

Rusts iterators are:

-   Lazy
-   Pervasive
-   Potentially infinite

== Where Do They Come From?

-   Collections like `Vec<T>` have an `iter()` function which yields an iterator.
-   Things like `std::net::TcpListener` which provides an iterator of ``TcpStream``s via ``incoming()``.
-   Functions like `str::split` and `str::split_n`
-   Iterators can be implemented on other structures as well.

== Owned iterators

[source,rust]
----
include::./1.rs[]
----

<1> this won't work

== Borrowed iterators

[.notes]
--

- point out that the `for` loop "unwraps" all `Some()`s returned by the iterator for us

== Mutably Borrowed iterators

== Common Uses

== `next()`

[.notes]
--

- ask participants what they think this returns
- point out that we see `Some()`s and a `None` here because there's not for loop to unwrap
  the return value of `next()` for us

Iterators can be advanced manually:

[source,rust]
----
include::./4.rs[]
----

== Combinators: `map()`

Transform items as they are evaluated:

[source,rust]
----
include::./5.rs[]
----

== Combinators: `filter()`

Filter out unwanted values, skipping further computation on them:

[source,rust]
----
include::./6.rs[]
----


== Returning Generic Iterators

Currently, Rust allows no generic return values. You have to use impl trait here.
