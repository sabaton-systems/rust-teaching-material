= Macros

== !

Rust has a macro language. See https://danielkeep.github.io/tlborm/book/README.html[The Little Book Of Macros].

== Important Macros

-   `println!(pattern, [values])` Easy printing of formatted strings to stdout
-   `format!(pattern, [values])` like `println!`, but returns Strings
-   `write!(buf, pattern, [values])` Simple writing of formatted data to a buffer

== What Can They do?

Macros can be used to things such as:

* Generate repetitive code.
* Create DSLs.
* Write things that would otherwise be hard without Macros.

== What do They Provide?

Macros are:

* **Hygienic**, expansion happens in a different 'syntax context'
* **Correct**, they cannot expand to invalid code.
* **Limited**, they cannot, for example, pollute their expansion site.

== Components of a Macro

A macro has three parts.

* A name, eg. `println`.
* A input portion, defining what the macro accepts.
* An output portion, defining how it expands.

== Macros: Syntax

Let's see how they look:

[source,rust]
----
include::./1.rs[]
----

== Macros: Syntax

The `($value:expr)` part says that:

> The macro accepts one parameter which is an expression.

Parameter types can be restricted.

For example, `$foo:ty` only accepts a type.

== Macros: Syntax

The parameters are prepended with a `$` to distinguish them.

Both in the input and output.

== Macros: Repetitions

[source,rust]
----
include::./2.rs[]
----

== Macros: Repetitions

When we see `$(...)*` this is signalling a repetition. It communicates:

> This portion of the macro takes a variable number of arguments.

Each repetition in the input should have a matching one in the output.

== Macros: Custom Syntax

[source,rust]
----
include::./3.rs[]
----

== Macros: Custom Syntax

Macros allow for a limited form of custom syntax and can be used to build simple DSLs.

For a good example of this, see https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs[clap-rs]

== Downsides of Macros

Macros:

* Can be difficult to debug.
* Can be confusing to read and understand.

== When Should You Use Macros?

Use macros where there are no other good alternatives.

Avoid overusing macros.
